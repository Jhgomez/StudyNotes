# Compilers 2 Concepts

## CISC vs RISC
- RISC instructions are simple, perform only one operation, and a CPU can execute them in one cycle while CISC instructions
- Decoding instructions in RISC is simple, whereas, in CISC is complex
- RISC doesn't require external memory for calculations, on the other hand CISC does
- RISC has multiple registers sets present, while CISC has onlly a single registe set

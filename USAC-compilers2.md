# Compilers 2 Concepts

## RISC vs CISC
RISC stands for "Reduced Instruction Cycle", CISC is "Complex Instruction Cycle". 

Comparison from RISC point of view:

upsides:

- RISC instructions are simple, perform only one operation, and a CPU can execute them in one cycle while CISC instructions
- Decoding instructions in RISC is simple, whereas, in CISC is complex. This means RISC executes faster
- RISC doesn't require external memory for calculations, on the other hand CISC does
- RISC has multiple registers sets present, while CISC has onlly a single registe set
- RISC processors power compsumption is lower, making them ideal for portable devices

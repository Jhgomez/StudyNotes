There is different ways we can start a repo and link it to the folder we are going to push. The first thing to do \
no matter the way you choose is to create an ssh key, you can have multiple accounts and just change a local domain and then make sure we point to the right remote domain, and in order to avoid starting the agent  every time you can configure this setting in the config file for each key. Your options are:\
	\
	1.- we can create a repo and clone it to the folder from terminal and then start the Android project,	GitHub will give you the instructions but basically they are, init git, add the remote to your git config\
\
	2.- We can create the repo and the project on different sides and then link them, I would just start	git(git init) in the folder, and then add the remote with \'93git remote add\'94 and the following is given by 	the repo provider, and remove the remote with \'93git remote rm origin\'94, you can check remote	 \'93git remote -v\'94 and then do the authenticate shell \'93ssh -T git@out.github.com\'94 the part after \'93@\'93 is	the local domain which is defined in your config file and this should be changed to different values if	there is more than one zsh key, meaning you can authenticate different users in the same computer\
\
	3.- We can create the project and then create the repo from our computer, gitHub should provide 	instructions to do this, but at least the first step should be make a \'93git init\'94}

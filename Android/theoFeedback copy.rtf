\f0\fs24 \cf0 Good:\
He communicates very well in English, despite having started with very short answers, this improved throughout the interview.\
\
During the process he explained different stages of the app creation process and it was clear that he had participated in all stages, something good for a developer with only 3 years in the area.\
\
I really liked the explanations about clean architecture, at first it seemed like memorized answers, but I was able to perfectly explain the different layers and their responsibilities.\
\
Another positive point was the experience with multi-module architecture. I could have gone deeper into the answer by giving practical examples. The answer was limited to a specific example where each layer (clean) was in a different module.\
\
To improve the answers, it would be interesting to expose more your opinion, for example: I prefer to work with Hilt instead of koin, because hilt generates java classes at compile time, which avoids crash at runtime and does not add any overhead in the app.\
\
\
To improve:\
\
The negative responses were pretty bad. When he didn't know the answer, he would just answer: "I don't know" or "I've never worked with that". I suggest answering more positively like "I haven't had the opportunity to work with this technology yet, but I know a little about it and I find it very interesting. It would be great to have an opportunity to learn about it."\
\
When I asked about git processes (git flow, trunk based) he couldn't answer. Your answer about code review was also a little weird. I got the feeling that he knows how to use git but without understanding the process. This can be a red flag for some companies. I suggest studying more about, especially about trunk based development.\
\
Another point that can be a red flag is the lack of experience in large teams and in agile processes. He did not know how to explain the type of process used in the last projects and also did not explain about any scrum ceremony. In general companies consider this important. I suggest studying about Scrum.\
\
Other points of improvement where the answers were insufficient are:\
- Unit tests and instrumented tests. I don't trust the answers. I got the feeling that he doesn't know how to write tests.\
- Feature flags. He couldn't explain properly the use of a feature flag. the answer was limited to "turn feature on and off remotely".\
- Does not have experience or know how to explain how AB tests work\
- Does not know how to ship an app to the store. A developer needs to know how to do that.\
- Does not know what a memory leak is.\
- Solid principle's answers seemed to memorize. I asked a question about the application of "dependency inversion" and he couldn't answer. Memorized answers are never a good option, the interviewer will know.\
\
There were other less important points where the answers were not satisfactory. But in general I think these are the main points to improve.\
\
Conclusion:\
\
Overall I think it was a good interview for an entry-mid level developer, which makes sense as he's only been working on Android for 3 years. I think maybe a little bit of experience is missing in large teams where the agile process is well defined.\
\
I think that good communication in English is an excellent positive point, but it would be interesting to go deeper into the answers, showing his opinion about the technologies. It is important to show that he understands the technology he is using.\
\
In the interview, I didn't evaluate other "senior" points such as "decision making", "doc creation", "debug process" because I didn't believe it made sense for his seniority.}
